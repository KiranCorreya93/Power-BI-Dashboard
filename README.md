Hospital Emergency Room Analysis - Power BI Dashboard

Overview
This Power BI dashboard provides a comprehensive analysis of a hospital's emergency room performance. It helps uncover key insights such as patient wait times, satisfaction scores, admission trends, and referral sources, enhancing operational efficiency and patient care.
Features

This project includes three dashboards:

1. Monthly View
Objective: Monitor key metrics and trends on a month-by-month basis to identify patterns and areas for improvement.
Charts Included:
* Patient Admission Status: Tracks admitted vs. non-admitted patients.
* Patient Age Distribution: Groups patients by 10-year age intervals.
* Department Referrals: Analyzes referral trends across different departments.
* Timeliness: Measures the percentage of patients seen within 30 minutes.
* Gender Analysis: Visualizes patient distribution by gender.
* Racial Demographics: Analyzes patient data by race.
* Time Analysis: Assesses patient volume by day and hour.
  
2. Consolidated View
Objective: Provide a holistic summary of hospital performance for a selected date range.
Charts Included:
* Similar metrics as the Monthly View but aggregated over a customizable date range for broader insights and trend analysis.
  
3. Patient Details
Objective: Offer granular insights into patient-level data to enable detailed analysis and troubleshooting.
Table Included:
* Patient ID
* Patient Full Name
* Gender
* Age
* Admission Date
* Patient Race
* Wait Time
